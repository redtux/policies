repository elsewhere, such as Github, are for backup purposes only.  If you
have contributions, submit them on via Conservancy's Kallithea instance.

These policies are discussed in public with Conservancy's member projects and
other Conservancy enthusiasts on
[the polices-discuss mailing list](http://lists.sfconservancy.org/mailman/listinfo/policies-discuss).

The 'master' branch in this repository denotes the current polices that are
in-effect for the Software Freedom Conservancy, Inc.  Proposals are made by
people in forked versions on Gitorious, and then if the
[Conservancy staff](https://sfconservancy.org/about/staff/) plans to propose
them to
[Conservancy's Board of Directors](https://sfconservancy.org/about/board/),
they are merged into the 'ready-for-board-approval' branch.  Once approved by
the Board of Directors, Conservancy staff merges the changes into the
'master' branch.
